# Help recuired: Health-Care-Duty-Roster
 Time taking medics to create duty rosters takes huge amout of time that is not built in our job plan and distracts from patients care. 
 Also, having a fair roster, is one of the most important factors that helps having well functioning team. 
 I am not a programmer, but I am trying to having this task automated, using python, so I can focus on what I do best, which is looking after patient.  
 I have created this code, but I do not think it is very effiecent. 
 The aim of the code is to :  
 1. distribute the over all days of the year equally on the staff (whenever possible) 
 2. distribute holidays of the year equally on the staff (whenever possible) 
 3. distribute weekends of the year equally on the staff (whenever possible) 
 4. distribute fridays of the year equally on the staff (whenever possible) 
 5. produce distribution statistics.
